# FrostDB
A proof of concept implementation of an idea I had called a [Cooperative Database System](https://github.com/dynamoRando/CooperativeDatabaseSystems) or CDBS.

In a CDBS, data ownership is respected for users of the CDBS and stored in a "Data Store" that users of a CDBS have authority over. This project is currently under development and is not ready for a release.
